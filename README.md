# Universal Robots Robot Arm for Warehouse Automation

This repository is a part of a larger project, which demonstrates a warehouse automation system built using three different types of robots; a Universal Robots robot arm, a Tello Edu drone, and a GoPiGo car. All robots communicate via a shared Websocket server, which gets notified of any orders that should be picked up from the warehouse using the project's own e-commerce website. This repository contains the implementation for the first Universal Robots robot arm.
